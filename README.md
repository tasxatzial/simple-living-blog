# Simple living blog

A simple website about minimalism in life.

This project is part of the responsive design course from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). [Design specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/75d448ea-569a-4b7e-721b-9bbd3b2b97b9-03e5/) and starter files are provided by [Kevin Powell](https://github.com/kevin-powell/reponsive-web-design-bootcamp).

## Implementation

* Responsive (flexbox, picture element).
* Mobile first design.

While my implementation follows the course content loosely, it also incorporates improvements that address most of the underlying issues.

## Dependencies

External:

* [:focus-visible](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible) polyfill.
* [Picturefill](https://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/) polyfill.

## Run locally
