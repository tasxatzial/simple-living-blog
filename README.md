# Simple living blog

A simple website about minimalism in life.

This project is part of the [Learn Responsive Web Design](https://scrimba.com/learn/responsive) course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com).

* [Design specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/75d448ea-569a-4b7e-721b-9bbd3b2b97b9-03e5/)

## Implementation

* Responsive + responsive image markup.
* Accessible.
* Mobile first approach.

While my implementation follows the course content loosely, it isn't an exact match of the design or the implementation shown in the course. I've made some intentional changes, with the aim of improving upon the provided design. Here's a non-exhaustive list:

* Responsiveness issues have been fixed.
* Accessibility features have been added/fixed.
* The 'recent posts' nav link has been removed as it was redundant.
* The first post now starts with an image. That makes it consistent with the format of the rest of the posts.
* Text font size, color, weight, and line height have been adjusted to make them more consistent across the page.
* The primary title of the page has been changed to match the content of the page.
