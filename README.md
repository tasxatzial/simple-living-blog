A simple website about minimalism in life.

This project is part of a course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com). [Design specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/75d448ea-569a-4b7e-721b-9bbd3b2b97b9-03e5/) and starter files are provided by [Kevin Powell](https://github.com/kevin-powell/reponsive-web-design-bootcamp).

## Implementation

* Responsive + responsive image markup.
* Accessible.
* Mobile first design.

While my implementation follows the course content loosely, it isn't an exact match of the design or the implementation shown in the course. I've made some intentional changes, with the aim of improving upon the provided design.
